# Multi-Class Cancer Classification


## Overview

### Cancer Classification using VGG, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNet
This notebook demonstrates the classification of cancer images using three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNet. It covers data preparation, model training with transfer learning, and performance evaluation, providing a comparison of these architectures in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

### Lymphoma and Oral Cancer Classification using iPPM
This notebook focuses on the classification of lymphoma and oral cancer images using a deep learning model based on the VGG19/MobileNetV3 architecture with iPPM. It includes steps for loading and preprocessing image data, building and training the model with transfer learning, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to distinguish between different types of lymphoma and identify oral cancer from image datasets.

### Cancer Classification with Grad-CAM Visualization
This notebook applies the Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) technique to visualize class activation maps for cancer images. It loads pre-trained models, processes input images, and generates heatmaps that highlight the regions of the images that the model focuses on when making predictions. This visualization helps in understanding the model's decision-making process and ensures the model's focus aligns with relevant areas of the images.
